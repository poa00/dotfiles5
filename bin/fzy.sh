### Overcome the limitation of POSIX shell

POSIX shell is very limited, and quite inefficient compared to compiling
language. Previously, I experimented the efficiency of POSIX shell in terms of
passing through all the argument array elements into the key detecting part:

> The efficiency of shellect is highly constraint by the total number of entries
> and the content that you want to display. With `bash`, as I tested, probably
> only numbers of 5000 is large enough to create significant lag. The command
> I run is `tree /directory/have/5000/subitems | shellect` or `echo $(seq 1 5000)
> | shellect`. With `dash`, the efficiency is highly depends on both directions.
> At the number 20000, shellect runs fair efficiency. The command is `tree
> /directory/have/20000/subitems | shellect`. With the number of 30000, the
> pointer will not stop if I relieve my key press. However, changing the command
> to `echo $(seq 1 30000) | shellect`, in my computer, shellect runs with fair

As an interpreting language, I found a way to avoid such inefficiency.

First, I'll define some terminologies that I'll use through the explanation:

1. argument array: POSIX shell has no array type. However, there's actually
   one, and only one array in POSIX shell, i.e., the positional parameters,
   `$1`, `$2`, etc.

   To see more information, go to "Working with arrays" section in [Richâ€™s sh (POSIX shell) tricks](http://www.etalabs.net/sh_tricks.html).

2. selection: the item in argument array that is defined in `$cur`.

3. Length of array: access by `$#`. The length of the total content is `$last`,
   and the length of a list is `$len`. `$len` is set to 500 if the length of
   the total content, `$last`, is larger than 500.


```sh
    while key=$(dd ibs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null); do
    ...
    done
```

This `while` loop is the part to detect key press. This `dd` command has
nothing to interact with the argument array. However, `dd`'s efficiency will be
highly affected by argument array that just pass through it. If the total
number of argument array is too high, then `dd` will become laggy when reading
the key press, eventually causing the cursor movement is laggy.

To resolve this limitation. I developed a technique to only feed part of the
total content to the above while loop:

```sh
key() {
    input_assign ...  # Generate a list which is part of the total content

    set -- $list # let the list to be argument array

    while key=$(dd ibs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null); do
    ...
	othercommand
	return 0 # Go back to main function and stay in the while loop in main function
    ...
	selection key pressed
	return 1 # Go back to main and leave the while loop in main function
    done
}

main() {
    ...
    while [ $? -eq 0 ]; do # If return 0, stay in while loop; others, leave the while loop
	set -- $content	# total content
	key "$@"
    done
}
```

The following steps are to actively switch between `main` function and `key`
function. Within the `$list`, the selection stay in the `while key` loop. If
the current selection ever go out of the `$list`, then go back to `main`
function, reload the `$content` and generate new `$list`, back to `while key`
loop, and process again. That is to say, user will experience an one-time
inaction when reach the boundary of `$list`. This inaction is to renew `$list`
to match current position in the whole `$content`. Press again, and the
selection will move to the next item.
